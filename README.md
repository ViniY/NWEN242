# NWEN242
NWEN242 2017
This course focus on low level programming, most of the programming part is using mips, which is using assembly language. And this 
course also includes lots concepts about the operation of the computer and the system.
This course had been replaced by NWEN342 and it is still have the same content that been covered by 242. 
Here are parts of the assignment I have done for this course, for most of them I got over 85%, and I also upload a course summary 
which may help to prepare for the final exam. Hope you enjoy this course.
