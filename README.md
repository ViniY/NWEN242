# NWEN242
NWEN242 2017 This course had been replaced by NWEN342 and it is still have the same content that been covered by 242. 
This course focus on low level programming, most of the programming part is using mips, which is using assembly language. And 
this course also includes lots concepts about the operation of the computer system.

summary which may help to prepare for the final exam. Hope you enjoy this course.
